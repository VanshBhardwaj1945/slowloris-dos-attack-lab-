**Author:** Vansh Bhardwaj  
**Repo / Project:** Slowloris Application-Layer DoS — Targeted Research (Lab)  
**Date:** December 2, 2025

## Short version (for busy readers)
This repository documents offensive techniques executed only in an isolated, authorized lab. If you discover a security issue in this repository or related artifacts, **do not post it publicly**. Instead, report it privately using the contact instructions below.

## Scope — what this covers
- In-scope: Code, scripts, configuration files, documentation, and artifacts contained *only in this repository*.  
- Out-of-scope: Any third-party systems, public/production servers, or resources you do not own or have no written authorization to test. Do not attempt to run the included attack against public or third-party infrastructure.

## If you find a vulnerability / security issue
Preferred method: **Email** me at: `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EMAIL`  
Alternative: Open a private GitHub issue or contact via GitHub handle: `@VanshBhardwaj1945` (please mark it private)

### What to include in your report
- Short title (one line) and severity estimate (low/medium/high/critical)
- A clear description of the issue
- Exact steps to reproduce (minimal, reproducible steps)
- Proof of concept (PoC) or supporting logs / packet captures (sanitized if necessary)
- Affected file(s)/commit hash / repository path
- Your contact details (email) so I can follow up

## How I will handle reports
- I will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days**.
- I will triage or provide a remediation plan within **30 days** for valid, in-scope issues.
- For critical issues that impact safety or privacy, I will aim to act faster and will coordinate disclosure timelines with the reporter.

## Communication

## Legal / safe-harbor statement
If you act in good faith to report a valid issue and follow this policy (report privately, do not exploit publicly), I will not pursue legal action. This repo documents lab work only; do not run these tools against systems you do not own or are not authorized to test.

## Responsible disclosure
- I prefer **coordinated disclosure**: allow time to fix before public disclosure. If you want to publish a report, please coordinate the timeline with me first.
- If I do not respond within the timelines above, you may contact GitHub Security or the relevant platform to escalate.

## Safety note for readers / contributors
- This repository contains exploit code and instructions intended only for isolated lab environments. Do not clone and run these tools against production or third-party infrastructure.
- Follow all applicable laws and your organization’s policies.

## Contact & escalation
- Primary: `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EMAIL`  
- GitHub: `https://github.com/VanshBhardwaj1945` (private issue / direct message)  
- If needed, escalate to GitHub Security if you cannot reach me.
